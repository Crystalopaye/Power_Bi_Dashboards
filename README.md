---

![Dashboard Page 1](/images/page1.png)

## Introduction
This project addresses a **key challenge** for professionals in the data field: the lack of a centralized, clear view of the job market. For **job seekers**, **career transitioners**, and those considering a **role swap**, fragmented data makes strategic planning difficult.

To solve this, I developed an **interactive Power BI dashboard** that transforms a raw, real-world dataset of 2024 data science job postings into actionable insights. Users can intuitively explore key market dimensions such as salary distributions (by title, experience, and location), geographic demand, and common role requirements—all within a single, unified interface.

## Technical Skills Showcased
### Data Processing & Modeling
- **Data Transformation (ETL)** : Engineered robust data pipelines using Power Query to clean, reshape, and prepare raw job posting data for analysis.

- **Implicit & DAX Measures** : Created dynamic calculations and KPIs using both implicit measures and custom DAX formulas for flexible, real-time analytics.

### Advanced Analytics & Visualization
- **Geospatial Analysis** : Built interactive maps to visualize regional job demand, salary distributions, and location-based market trends.

- **Core Chart Mastery** : Designed intuitive bar/column charts, line graphs, and scatter plots to reveal patterns in compensation, experience requirements, and role frequency.

- **KPI & Tabular Reporting** : Developed key performance indicators (KPIs) and detailed tables to present salary benchmarks, role counts, and market metrics at a glance.

### Dashboard Engineering & UX
- **Interactive Dashboard Design** : Crafted a cohesive, user-centric interface with logical layout, color theory, and clear visual hierarchy.

- **Dynamic User Controls** :

1. **Slicers** : Implemented multi-dimensional filters for role, location, experience level, and salary range.

2. **Buttons & Bookmarks** : Created navigation systems and view toggles for seamless exploration between dashboard "pages" or focused analyses.

3. **Drill-Through Pages** : Built contextual detail reports allowing users to drill from summary views into granular, role-specific data.

- **End-to-End Reporting** : Delivered a complete, self-service analytical tool that transforms raw data into actionable insights through interactive exploration.

## Dashboard Overview

This dashboard provides a high-level summary of the 2024 data job market. It offers key metrics including **total job count, salary trends, and median compensation**, enabling users to quickly assess market demand and earning potential across roles like **Data Engineer, Data Scientist, and Machine Learning Engineer**.

**Key Insights Presented**:

- **Market Volume** : Total job count (479K) and monthly trends across 2024

- **Compensation Benchmark** : Median annual ($113K) and hourly ($47.62) salaries

- **Role Comparison** : Ranking of highest-paying data job titles

- **Salary Distribution** : Visual breakdown of compensation by role and job volume

### Page 2 : Job Title Drill Through

This page is a Drill-Through view, providing granular detail for a specific job title selected on the main dashboard. When a user clicks on a role like "Data Engineer" from the chart or list on Page 1, they are directed here to explore detailed metrics such as salary breakdowns, work flexibility, benefits, and geographic distribution for that role alone.


## Conclusion
This Power BI dashboard successfully transforms complex, fragmented job market data into an intuitive and actionable analytics tool. By centralizing key metrics on salary, demand, and role specifications into interactive visualizations, it empowers data professionals to make informed, strategic career decisions. The project demonstrates effective data storytelling and user-centric design, bridging the gap between raw data and real-world insight.
