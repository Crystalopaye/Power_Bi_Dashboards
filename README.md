# My Power BI Dashboard Portfolio
---
Welcome to my Power BI Dashboard Portfolio! This repository showcases a collection of interactive dashboards and reports I've developed using Microsoft Power BI. Each project demonstrates my growing expertise in data transformation, visualization, and business intelligence.


# Featured Dashboards
Dive into the dashboards showcased below. Every project has a dedicated README that walks you through the build process, highlights unique features, and explains the technical decisions behind each visualization.
